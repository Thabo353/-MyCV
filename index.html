        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Thabo Raymond Kganyago, I was born and bread in Limpopo just outside the village called Ga Mashashane. 
            Growing up i wanted to study Electric engeneering nor enveronmental science, due to low marks optained my mother opted mechanical engeneering for me but i dropped out.
            After returning home I got an opportunity to work in building construction, that is where is got inspired by this other lady visiting our site as project manager.
            She told me all about the course, the following year i quitted that job so I can study that it that was in 2018.
            I came Jorbug in 2019 were I worked as mechanic for a certain company until I was informed about post from First Technology looking for internship.
            It was worth a try, with 4 years of experience in IT support, I am constantly motivated by new challenges and aim to transition into software development.
            And words for old white man I met at UNISA said "never be afreid of challenging posts though you know you do not qualify"
            I applied it happened I become one of the shortlisted candidate, that is were my journey of being IT technician began.
            
            Being into IT space it is so fascinating because there are lot of issues we deal with even though is not daily/weekly which are so challenging. 
            Currently I am senior technician. The is always something to learn mostly when software is upgrated or changed.
            I get motivation from alot of people I meet to always want to learn more hence I decided to take thing software engeneering course. I need something more challenging.
            My achivement is to see myself as one of respected guys in the company or managing the department.</p>
